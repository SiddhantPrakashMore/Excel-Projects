Embark on a journey through the intricacies of urban mobility with our Excel-based analysis of bike share data. This project meticulously navigates the raw data, utilizing advanced Excel functionalities to unveil insightful trends and patterns, guiding the way towards improved urban transportation solutions.

Our journey commences with the acquisition of raw data, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive analysis. Through diligent data cleaning, we eliminate duplicates and standardize categorical variables, enhancing clarity and coherence within our dataset. Leveraging Excel's versatile tools, we translate abbreviations into understandable labels and refine gender categories for enhanced comprehension.

With a refined dataset at our disposal, our analysis delves deeper into the dynamics of bike share usage. Strategic feature engineering allows us to segment users by age, providing valuable insights into demographics and preferences. Excel's formula capabilities facilitate seamless categorization, illuminating nuanced patterns and behaviors.

At the core of our analysis lie data-driven insights, revealing key metrics such as income disparities among bike purchasers by gender and the distribution of purchases across different commute distances. Excel's analytical prowess empowers robust calculations and visualizations, enabling stakeholders to extract actionable intelligence.

Our project culminates in a dynamic dashboard, offering stakeholders an interactive platform for exploration and analysis. With slicers enabling effortless filtering and drill-down capabilities, users can uncover tailored insights, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.
